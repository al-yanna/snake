The arcade snake game written in JavaScript and HTML. When the snake's head (the leading blue box) lands on top of the food (the yellow square), the food is randomly generated somewhere else in the grid and the length of the snake is updated (+1). The game is lost when the snake's head runs into any part of its body or the end of the grid.
