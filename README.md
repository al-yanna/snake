The arcade snake game written with JavaScript and HTML. When the snake's head (the leading blue box) lands on top of the food (the yellow square), the food is randomly generated somewhere else in the matrix and the length of the snake is updated (+1). The game is lost when the snake's head runs into any part of its body or the end of the matrix.

## How to Play

* Use arrow keys to move the snake to direction of the food. 
* Note: The snake cannot go backwards to itself.
